# Software Design

> A Language-Agnostic Lab for Building and Rebuilding Software with an Eye for Quality

---

## About

**This repository is not about "software design patterns" in the classical sense.**  
Instead, it’s my personal laboratory for becoming a better engineer by reconstructing essential software from the ground up.

The focus here is on:

- Practicing the design and implementation of foundational software components
- Exploring and comparing ideas across different programming languages
- Studying what makes software robust, performant, maintainable, and elegant

This is a place for *active learning*, not just code accumulation.

---

## Purpose

By reimplementing classic solutions from scratch, I hope to:

- Develop a deep, language-agnostic understanding of software construction
- Learn the tradeoffs behind design decisions, performance, and usability
- Strengthen my ability to independently reason about architecture and implementation

This repo tracks my progress, experiments, and insights along the way.

## What You'll Find

- Multiple projects, each tackling a classic or core software problem  
- Implementations in various languages, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each
- In-project documentation and reflections on design choices, testing, and gotchas
- Iterative improvements—sometimes the "first draft" is intentionally unrefined to allow learning by revision

---

## Philosophy

- **Learning by Building:**  
  There’s no shortcut to understanding complex systems—practice is everything.

- **Reinvention on Purpose:**  
  Re-creating what’s already solved helps internalize concepts and exposes new perspectives.

- **Quality over Quantity:**  
  Focus on clarity, correctness, and design, even at the expense of “feature-completeness.”

- **Language-Agnostic:**  
  There’s value in solving the same problem in several languages, observing how paradigms and language design shape your approach.

- **Iterative, Honest Learning:**  
  Expect stumbles and ugly code sometimes—improvement comes from reflection and revision.

## Structure

Each project lives in its own subdirectory, usually with implementations in several languages.  
See each project’s folder for documentation, commentary, and design notes.

## Contributions

Suggestions, feedback, and alternative implementations are welcome! Open a pull request or an issue if you’d like to discuss improvements or showcase a different design style.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the spirit of “build your own” and the classic engineering advice to "learn from the ground up."
